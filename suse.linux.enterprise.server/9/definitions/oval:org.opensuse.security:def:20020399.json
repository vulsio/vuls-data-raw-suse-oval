    "Description": "\n\tDirectory traversal vulnerability in GNU tar 1.13.19 through 1.13.25, and possibly later versions, allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via a (1) \"/..\" or (2) \"./..\" string, which removes the leading slash but leaves the \"..\", a variant of CVE-2001-1267.ISC BIND 9 before 9.2.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (shutdown) via a malformed DNS packet that triggers an error condition that is not properly handled when the rdataset parameter to the dns_message_findtype() function in message.c is not NULL, aka DoS_findtype.SMB dissector in Ethereal 0.9.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via malformed packets that cause Ethereal to dereference a NULL pointer.Buffer overflow in X11 dissector in Ethereal 0.9.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms.DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet that causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop.Vulnerability in GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).\n\t",

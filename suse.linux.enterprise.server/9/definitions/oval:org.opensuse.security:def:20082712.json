    "Description": "\n\tVim 7.1.314, 6.4, and other versions allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via Vim scripts that do not properly sanitize inputs before invoking the execute or system functions, as demonstrated using (1) filetype.vim, (3) xpm.vim, (4) gzip_vim, and (5) netrw.  NOTE: the originally reported version was 7.1.314, but the researcher actually found this set of issues in 7.1.298.  NOTE: the zipplugin issue (originally vector 2 in this identifier) has been subsumed by CVE-2008-3075.\n\t",

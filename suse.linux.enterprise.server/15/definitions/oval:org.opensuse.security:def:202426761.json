		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/pci: Fix disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWS window\n\nThe Linux CXL subsystem is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA.\nThat is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM decoder registers are\nprogrammed with are system physical addresses (SPA).\n\nDuring HDM decoder setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1,\n8.1.3.8) are checked if the memory is enabled and the CXL range is in\na HPA window that is described in a CFMWS structure of the CXL host\nbridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3).\n\nNow, if the HPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a CFMWS\nwindow and the CXL memory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder\nstops working which causes system memory being disabled and further a\nsystem hang during HDM decoder initialization, typically when a CXL\nenabled kernel boots.\n\nPrevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if the\ndecoder's CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.\n\nNote the change only fixes a hardware hang, but does not implement\nHPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be added in a follow on\npatch series.\n    ",

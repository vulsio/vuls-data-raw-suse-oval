		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer\n\nBoth Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to\nfail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state.  The actual\nconditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems\nplausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page\nand invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing\nXRSTOR on the page in question.\n\n__fpu__restore_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registers\nare preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using the\nfpu_fpregs_owner_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail but\nmodify the registers.\n\nIf this happens, then there is a window in which __fpu__restore_sig()\ncould schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in without\nreloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPU\nstate that __fpu__restore_sig() was attempting to load leaking into the\nvictim task's user-visible state.\n\nInvalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent this\nsituation from corrupting any state.\n\n[1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine \"complex\n    microarchitectural conditions\".\n    ",

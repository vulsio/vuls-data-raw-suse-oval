		"Description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO drain\n\nPreviously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX FIFO to\nread any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This behaviour is\ncorrect when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However in DMA mode the\ntransfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all bytes to be\ntransferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point data in the FIFO\nstill needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus the drain procedure\nand DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO, corrupting any data\nread. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never adjusted according to\nDMA progress in DMA mode, thus calling the RX FIFO drain procedure in DMA\nmode is a bug.\nFix corruptions in DMA RX mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode.\nAlso wait for completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to\nensure all data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.\n    ",

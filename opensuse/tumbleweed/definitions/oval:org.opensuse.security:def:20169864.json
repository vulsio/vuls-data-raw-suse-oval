		"Description": "\n    An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. With a crafted username or a table name, it was possible to inject SQL statements in the tracking functionality that would run with the privileges of the control user. This gives read and write access to the tables of the configuration storage database, and if the control user has the necessary privileges, read access to some tables of the MySQL database. All 4.6.x versions (prior to 4.6.5), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.9), and 4.0.x versions (prior to 4.0.10.18) are affected.\n    ",

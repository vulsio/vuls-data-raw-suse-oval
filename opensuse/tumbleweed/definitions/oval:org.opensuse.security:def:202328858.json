		"Description": "\n    redis-py before 4.5.3 leaves a connection open after canceling an async Redis command at an inopportune time, and can send response data to the client of an unrelated request in an off-by-one manner. NOTE: this CVE Record was initially created in response to reports about ChatGPT, and 4.3.6, 4.4.3, and 4.5.3 were released (changing the behavior for pipeline operations); however, please see CVE-2023-28859 about addressing data leakage across AsyncIO connections in general.\n    ",

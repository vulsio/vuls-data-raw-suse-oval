The temporary file's permissions are defaulted to the user's\ncurrent `umask` settings, meaning that it's possible for other users on the\nsame system to read the contents of the temporary file.\n\nAttackers that have access to the file system could possibly read the contents\nof this temporary file while a user is editing it.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n    ",

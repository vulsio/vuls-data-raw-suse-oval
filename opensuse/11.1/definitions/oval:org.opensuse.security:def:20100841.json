		"Description": "\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the ImageIO component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 18, 5.0 Update 23, and 1.4.2_25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the March 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the Java Runtime Environment that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a JPEG image that contains subsample dimensions with large values, related to JPEGImageReader and \"stepX\".\n\t",

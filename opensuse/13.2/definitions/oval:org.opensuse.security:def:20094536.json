		"Description": "\n    drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c in the e1000 driver in the Linux kernel 2.6.32.3 and earlier handles Ethernet frames that exceed the MTU by processing certain trailing payload data as if it were a complete frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass packet filters via a large packet with a crafted payload.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2009-1385.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-iocost: do not WARN if iocg was already offlined\n\nIn iocg_pay_debt(), warn is triggered if 'active_list' is empty, which\nis intended to confirm iocg is active when it has debt. However, warn\ncan be triggered during a blkcg or disk removal, if iocg_waitq_timer_fn()\nis run at that time:\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2344971 at block/blk-iocost.c:1402 iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190\n  Call trace:\n  iocg_pay_debt+0x14c/0x190\n  iocg_kick_waitq+0x438/0x4c0\n  iocg_waitq_timer_fn+0xd8/0x130\n  __run_hrtimer+0x144/0x45c\n  __hrtimer_run_queues+0x16c/0x244\n  hrtimer_interrupt+0x2cc/0x7b0\n\nThe warn in this situation is meaningless. Since this iocg is being\nremoved, the state of the 'active_list' is irrelevant, and 'waitq_timer'\nis canceled after removing 'active_list' in ioc_pd_free(), which ensures\niocg is freed after iocg_waitq_timer_fn() returns.\n\nTherefore, add the check if iocg was already offlined to avoid warn\nwhen removing a blkcg or disk.\n    ",

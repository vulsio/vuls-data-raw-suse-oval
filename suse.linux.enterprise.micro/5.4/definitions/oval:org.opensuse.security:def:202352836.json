		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlocking/ww_mutex/test: Fix potential workqueue corruption\n\nIn some cases running with the test-ww_mutex code, I was seeing\nodd behavior where sometimes it seemed flush_workqueue was\nreturning before all the work threads were finished.\n\nOften this would cause strange crashes as the mutexes would be\nfreed while they were being used.\n\nLooking at the code, there is a lifetime problem as the\ncontrolling thread that spawns the work allocates the\n\"struct stress\" structures that are passed to the workqueue\nthreads. Then when the workqueue threads are finished,\nthey free the stress struct that was passed to them.\n\nUnfortunately the workqueue work_struct node is in the stress\nstruct. Which means the work_struct is freed before the work\nthread returns and while flush_workqueue is waiting.\n\nIt seems like a better idea to have the controlling thread\nboth allocate and free the stress structures, so that we can\nbe sure we don't corrupt the workqueue by freeing the structure\nprematurely.\n\nSo this patch reworks the test to do so, and with this change\nI no longer see the early flush_workqueue returns.\n    ",

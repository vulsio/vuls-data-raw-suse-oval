		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal\n\nIf the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply\nor MST up request sideband message, the\ndrm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset\nfrom one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with\nthe reading/parsing of the message from another thread via\ndrm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is\npossible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing\nthe reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the\nreader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 (\"drm/dp_mst: Fix MST\nsideband message body length check\").\n\nFix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before\nreading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the\ndrm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message\nreception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and\ndrm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), however this would require a bigger change.\nSince the fix is also needed for stable, opting for the simpler solution\nin this patch.\n    ",

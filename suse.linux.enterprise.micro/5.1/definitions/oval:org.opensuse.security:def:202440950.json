		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: huge_memory: fix misused mapping_large_folio_support() for anon folios\n\nWhen I did a large folios split test, a WARNING \"[ 5059.122759][ T166]\nCannot split file folio to non-0 order\" was triggered.  But the test cases\nare only for anonmous folios.  while mapping_large_folio_support() is only\nreasonable for page cache folios.\n\nIn split_huge_page_to_list_to_order(), the folio passed to\nmapping_large_folio_support() maybe anonmous folio.  The folio_test_anon()\ncheck is missing.  So the split of the anonmous THP is failed.  This is\nalso the same for shmem_mapping().  We'd better add a check for both.  But\nthe shmem_mapping() in __split_huge_page() is not involved, as for\nanonmous folios, the end parameter is set to -1, so (head[i].index >= end)\nis always false.  shmem_mapping() is not called.\n\nAlso add a VM_WARN_ON_ONCE() in mapping_large_folio_support() for anon\nmapping, So we can detect the wrong use more easily.\n\nTHP folios maybe exist in the pagecache even the file system doesn't\nsupport large folio, it is because when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE is\nenabled, khugepaged will try to collapse read-only file-backed pages to\nTHP.  But the mapping does not actually support multi order large folios\nproperly.\n\nUsing /sys/kernel/debug/split_huge_pages to verify this, with this patch,\nlarge anon THP is successfully split and the warning is ceased.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock\n\nThe following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the\ndeadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:\n\n- j1939_socks_lock\n- active_session_list_lock\n- sk_session_queue_lock\n\nA reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in\nthe rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list\nthat j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to\nacquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,\nwhere, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock\nand attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,\nanother thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding\nsk_session_queue_lock.\n\nNOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug\nreported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare\nfor one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which\nappears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.\n\n[mkl: remove unrelated newline change]\n    ",

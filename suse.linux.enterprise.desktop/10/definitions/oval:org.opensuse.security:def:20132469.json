    "Description": "\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue allows remote attackers to bypass the Java sandbox via vectors related to \"Incorrect image layout verification\" in 2D.\n\t",

    "Description": "\n\tUnspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier, 6 Update 45 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 45 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Networking.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue allows remote attackers to obtain a socket's local address via vectors involving inconsistencies between Socket.getLocalAddress and InetAddress.getLocalHost.\n\t",

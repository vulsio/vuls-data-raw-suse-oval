An attacker can use the?ApplyFiltersAndEncode() function and loop through to free best.bw and assign best = trial pointer. The second loop will then return 0 because of an Out of memory error in VP8 encoder, the pointer is still assigned to trial and the AddressSanitizer will attempt a double free.?\n\n    ",

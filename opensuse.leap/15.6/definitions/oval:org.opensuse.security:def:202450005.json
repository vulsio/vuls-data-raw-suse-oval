		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker\n\nIn the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was\naccessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According\nto RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable\nbehavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing\nuse-after-free issues.\n\nThis possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed\nby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.\n\nTo address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local\nvariable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical\nsection. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,\nensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU\nrules.\n    ",

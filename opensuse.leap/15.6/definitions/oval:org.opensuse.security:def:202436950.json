		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirewire: ohci: mask bus reset interrupts between ISR and bottom half\n\nIn the FireWire OHCI interrupt handler, if a bus reset interrupt has\noccurred, mask bus reset interrupts until bus_reset_work has serviced and\ncleared the interrupt.\n\nNormally, we always leave bus reset interrupts masked. We infer the bus\nreset from the self-ID interrupt that happens shortly thereafter. A\nscenario where we unmask bus reset interrupts was introduced in 2008 in\na007bb857e0b26f5d8b73c2ff90782d9c0972620: If\nOHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS (8) is set in the debug parameter bitmask, we\nwill unmask bus reset interrupts so we can log them.\n\nirq_handler logs the bus reset interrupt. However, we can't clear the bus\nreset event flag in irq_handler, because we won't service the event until\nlater. irq_handler exits with the event flag still set. If the\ncorresponding interrupt is still unmasked, the first bus reset will\nusually freeze the system due to irq_handler being called again each\ntime it exits. This freeze can be reproduced by loading firewire_ohci\nwith \"modprobe firewire_ohci debug=-1\" (to enable all debugging output).\nApparently there are also some cases where bus_reset_work will get called\nsoon enough to clear the event, and operation will continue normally.\n\nThis freeze was first reported a few months after a007bb85 was committed,\nbut until now it was never fixed. The debug level could safely be set\nto -1 through sysfs after the module was loaded, but this would be\nineffectual in logging bus reset interrupts since they were only\nunmasked during initialization.\n\nirq_handler will now leave the event flag set but mask bus reset\ninterrupts, so irq_handler won't be called again and there will be no\nfreeze. If OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS is enabled, bus_reset_work will\nunmask the interrupt after servicing the event, so future interrupts\nwill be caught as desired.\n\nAs a side effect to this change, OHCI_PARAM_DEBUG_BUSRESETS can now be\nenabled through sysfs in addition to during initial module loading.\nHowever, when enabled through sysfs, logging of bus reset interrupts will\nbe effective only starting with the second bus reset, after\nbus_reset_work has executed.\n    ",

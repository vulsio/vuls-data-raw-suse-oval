		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow\n\nSince \"dev_search_path\" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX,\nthere was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string\ninto \"full_path\" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were\nreporting this warning:\n\ndrivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c: In function 'process_msg_open.isra':\ndrivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:51: warning: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 254 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Wformat-truncation=]\n  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, \"%s/%s\",\n      |                                                   ^~\nIn function 'rnbd_srv_get_full_path',\n    inlined from 'process_msg_open.isra' at drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:721:14: drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:17: note: 'snprintf' output between 2 and 4351 bytes into a destination of size 4096\n  616 |                 snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, \"%s/%s\",\n      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n  617 |                          dev_search_path, dev_name);\n      |                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo fix this, unconditionally check for truncation (as was already done\nfor the case where \"%SESSNAME%\" was present).\n    ",

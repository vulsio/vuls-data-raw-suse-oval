		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag\n\nSyzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects\nfilesystem corruption and degrades to read-only,\n__block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may\nfail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size,\ntriggering a kernel bug.\n\nThis was found to be because the \"checked\" flag of a page/folio was not\ncleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the\nsanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory\npage/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.\n\nThis was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was\napplied to more than just metadata files.\n    ",

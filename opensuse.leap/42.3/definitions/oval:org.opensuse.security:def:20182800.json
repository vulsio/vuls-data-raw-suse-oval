		"Description": "\n    Vulnerability in the Java SE, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: RMI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u181, 7u171 and 8u162; JRockit: R28.3.17. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, JRockit accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, JRockit accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).\n    ",

		"Description": "\n    The UNIX pipe which sudo uses to contact SSSD and read the available sudo rules from SSSD has too wide permissions, which means that anyone who can send a message using the same raw protocol that sudo and SSSD use can read the sudo rules available for any user. This affects versions of SSSD before 1.16.3.\n    ",

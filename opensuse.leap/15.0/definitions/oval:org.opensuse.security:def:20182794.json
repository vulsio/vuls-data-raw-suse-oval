    "Description": "\n    Vulnerability in the Java SE, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u181, 7u171, 8u162, 10 and JRockit: R28.3.17. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Java SE, JRockit executes to compromise Java SE, JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, JRockit, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, JRockit. Note: Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n    ",

    "Description": "\n    The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka \"KNOB\") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing.\n    ",

This vulnerability is an instance of a use after free vulnerability in the Primetime SDK metadata functionality. The mismatch between an old and a new object can provide an attacker with unintended memory access -- potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow hijack, or an information leak attack. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    ",

		"Description": "\n    An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic Authentication with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to store the decoded data. Squid does not check that the decoded length isn't greater than the buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow with user controlled data.\n    ",

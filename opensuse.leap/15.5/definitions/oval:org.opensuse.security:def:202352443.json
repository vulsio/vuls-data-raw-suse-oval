		"Description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\napparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty\n\nWhen processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like\n\n \"profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}\"\n\na string \":samba-dcerpcd\" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then\npassed to aa_splitn_fqname().\n\naa_splitn_fqname() treats \":samba-dcerpcd\" as only containing a namespace.\nThus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later\naa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.\n\ngeneral protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000000: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]\nCPU: 6 PID: 1657 Comm: apparmor_parser Not tainted 6.7.0-rc2-dirty #16\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.2-3-gd478f380-rebuilt.opensuse.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:strlen+0x1e/0xa0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? strlen+0x1e/0xa0\n aa_policy_init+0x1bb/0x230\n aa_alloc_profile+0xb1/0x480\n unpack_profile+0x3bc/0x4960\n aa_unpack+0x309/0x15e0\n aa_replace_profiles+0x213/0x33c0\n policy_update+0x261/0x370\n profile_replace+0x20e/0x2a0\n vfs_write+0x2af/0xe00\n ksys_write+0x126/0x250\n do_syscall_64+0x46/0xf0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6e/0x76\n </TASK>\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\nRIP: 0010:strlen+0x1e/0xa0\n\nIt seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in\nother places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there\nis an explicit comment \"a ns name without a following profile is allowed\"\ninside.\n\nAFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked \"name\" to be in form like\n\":samba-dcerpcd\" - it is passed from userspace.\n\nDeny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with\nEPROTO and an explaining message.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).\n    ",

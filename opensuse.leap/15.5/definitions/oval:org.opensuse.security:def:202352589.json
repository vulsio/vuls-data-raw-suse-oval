		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue\n\nIn rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the\ninterrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't\nbe running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as\nthe interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the\nISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured\nframe.\n\nThis brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the\ninterrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to\nboard lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that\ndisables the streaming might do things that conflict.\n\nIt is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with\na suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,\nleading to board lockup.\n    ",

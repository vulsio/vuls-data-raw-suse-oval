Such MEMBLOCK_NOMAP regions\nshould not be saved during hibernation.\n\nThis problem was introduced by changes to the pfn_valid() logic in\ncommit a7d9f306ba70 (\"arm64: drop pfn_valid_within() and simplify\npfn_valid()\").\n\nSimilar to other architectures, drop the !can_set_direct_map() check in\nkernel_page_present() so that page_is_savable() skips such pages.\n\n[catalin.marinas@arm.com: rework commit message]\n    ",

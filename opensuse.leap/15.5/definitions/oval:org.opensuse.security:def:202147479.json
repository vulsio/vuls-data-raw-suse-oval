		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nstaging: rtl8712: fix use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw\n\nSyzbot reported use-after-free in rtl8712_dl_fw(). The problem was in\nrace condition between r871xu_dev_remove() ->ndo_open() callback.\n\nIt's easy to see from crash log, that driver accesses released firmware\nin ->ndo_open() callback. It may happen, since driver was releasing\nfirmware _before_ unregistering netdev. Fix it by moving\nunregister_netdev() before cleaning up resources.\n\nCall Trace:\n...\n rtl871x_open_fw drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:83 [inline]\n rtl8712_dl_fw+0xd95/0xe10 drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:170\n rtl8712_hal_init drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:330 [inline]\n rtl871x_hal_init+0xae/0x180 drivers/staging/rtl8712/hal_init.c:394\n netdev_open+0xe6/0x6c0 drivers/staging/rtl8712/os_intfs.c:380\n __dev_open+0x2bc/0x4d0 net/core/dev.c:1484\n\nFreed by task 1306:\n...\n release_firmware+0x1b/0x30 drivers/base/firmware_loader/main.c:1053\n r871xu_dev_remove+0xcc/0x2c0 drivers/staging/rtl8712/usb_intf.c:599\n usb_unbind_interface+0x1d8/0x8d0 drivers/usb/core/driver.c:458\n    ",

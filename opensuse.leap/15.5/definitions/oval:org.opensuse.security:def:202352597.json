		"Description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: s390: fix setting of fpc register\n\nkvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu() allows to set the floating point control\n(fpc) register of a guest cpu. The new value is tested for validity by\ntemporarily loading it into the fpc register.\n\nThis may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process:\nif an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc\nregister, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registers\nare used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()\nassuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers\nwhen returning to user space.\n\ntest_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process fpc register\nvalue, however it will be discarded, when returning to user space.\n\nIn result the host process will incorrectly continue to run with the value\nthat was supposed to be used for a guest cpu.\n\nFix this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before\nthe SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values.\n\nThis results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted\ninstead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,\ngiven that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is in\naddition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface\n(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c.\n    ",

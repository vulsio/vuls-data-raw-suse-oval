		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: fix tc flower deletion for VLAN priority Rx steering\n\nTo replicate the issue:-\n\n1) Add 1 flower filter for VLAN Priority based frame steering:-\n$ IFDEVNAME=eth0\n$ tc qdisc add dev $IFDEVNAME ingress\n$ tc qdisc add dev $IFDEVNAME root mqprio num_tc 8 \\\n   map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \\\n   queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0\n$ tc filter add dev $IFDEVNAME parent ffff: protocol 802.1Q \\\n   flower vlan_prio 0 hw_tc 0\n\n2) Get the 'pref' id\n$ tc filter show dev $IFDEVNAME ingress\n\n3) Delete a specific tc flower record (say pref 49151)\n$ tc filter del dev $IFDEVNAME parent ffff: pref 49151\n\nFrom dmesg, we will observe kernel NULL pointer ooops\n\n[  197.170464] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n[  197.171367] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[  197.171367] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[  197.171367] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[  197.171367] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n\n<snip>\n\n[  197.171367] RIP: 0010:tc_setup_cls+0x20b/0x4a0 [stmmac]\n\n<snip>\n\n[  197.171367] Call Trace:\n[  197.171367]  <TASK>\n[  197.171367]  ? __stmmac_disable_all_queues+0xa8/0xe0 [stmmac]\n[  197.171367]  stmmac_setup_tc_block_cb+0x70/0x110 [stmmac]\n[  197.171367]  tc_setup_cb_destroy+0xb3/0x180\n[  197.171367]  fl_hw_destroy_filter+0x94/0xc0 [cls_flower]\n\nThe above issue is due to previous incorrect implementation of\ntc_del_vlan_flow(), shown below, that uses flow_cls_offload_flow_rule()\nto get struct flow_rule *rule which is no longer valid for tc filter\ndelete operation.\n\n  struct flow_rule *rule = flow_cls_offload_flow_rule(cls);\n  struct flow_dissector *dissector = rule->match.dissector;\n\nSo, to ensure tc_del_vlan_flow() deletes the right VLAN cls record for\nearlier configured RX queue (configured by hw_tc) in tc_add_vlan_flow(),\nthis patch introduces stmmac_rfs_entry as driver-side flow_cls_offload\nrecord for 'RX frame steering' tc flower, currently used for VLAN\npriority. The implementation has taken consideration for future extension\nto include other type RX frame steering such as EtherType based.\n\nv2:\n - Clean up overly extensive backtrace and rewrite git message to better\n   explain the kernel NULL pointer issue.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring/io-wq: Use set_bit() and test_bit() at worker->flags\n\nUtilize set_bit() and test_bit() on worker->flags within io_uring/io-wq\nto address potential data races.\n\nThe structure io_worker->flags may be accessed through various data\npaths, leading to concurrency issues. When KCSAN is enabled, it reveals\ndata races occurring in io_worker_handle_work and\nio_wq_activate_free_worker functions.\n\n\t BUG: KCSAN: data-race in io_worker_handle_work / io_wq_activate_free_worker\n\t write to 0xffff8885c4246404 of 4 bytes by task 49071 on cpu 28:\n\t io_worker_handle_work (io_uring/io-wq.c:434 io_uring/io-wq.c:569)\n\t io_wq_worker (io_uring/io-wq.c:?)\n<snip>\n\n\t read to 0xffff8885c4246404 of 4 bytes by task 49024 on cpu 5:\n\t io_wq_activate_free_worker (io_uring/io-wq.c:? io_uring/io-wq.c:285)\n\t io_wq_enqueue (io_uring/io-wq.c:947)\n\t io_queue_iowq (io_uring/io_uring.c:524)\n\t io_req_task_submit (io_uring/io_uring.c:1511)\n\t io_handle_tw_list (io_uring/io_uring.c:1198)\n<snip>\n\nLine numbers against commit 18daea77cca6 (\"Merge tag 'for-linus' of\ngit://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm\").\n\nThese races involve writes and reads to the same memory location by\ndifferent tasks running on different CPUs. To mitigate this, refactor\nthe code to use atomic operations such as set_bit(), test_bit(), and\nclear_bit() instead of basic \"and\" and \"or\" operations. This ensures\nthread-safe manipulation of worker flags.\n\nAlso, move `create_index` to avoid holes in the structure.\n    ",

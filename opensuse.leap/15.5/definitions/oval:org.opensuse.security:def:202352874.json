		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/tdx: Zero out the missing RSI in TDX_HYPERCALL macro\n\nIn the TDX_HYPERCALL asm, after the TDCALL instruction returns from the\nuntrusted VMM, the registers that the TDX guest shares to the VMM need\nto be cleared to avoid speculative execution of VMM-provided values.\n\nRSI is specified in the bitmap of those registers, but it is missing\nwhen zeroing out those registers in the current TDX_HYPERCALL.\n\nIt was there when it was originally added in commit 752d13305c78\n(\"x86/tdx: Expand __tdx_hypercall() to handle more arguments\"), but was\nlater removed in commit 1e70c680375a (\"x86/tdx: Do not corrupt\nframe-pointer in __tdx_hypercall()\"), which was correct because %rsi is\nlater restored in the \"pop %rsi\".  However a later commit 7a3a401874be\n(\"x86/tdx: Drop flags from __tdx_hypercall()\") removed that \"pop %rsi\"\nbut forgot to add the \"xor %rsi, %rsi\" back.\n\nFix by adding it back.\n    ",

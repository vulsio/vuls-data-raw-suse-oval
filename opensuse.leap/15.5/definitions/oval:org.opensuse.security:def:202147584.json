		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niocost: Fix divide-by-zero on donation from low hweight cgroup\n\nThe donation calculation logic assumes that the donor has non-zero\nafter-donation hweight, so the lowest active hweight a donating cgroup can\nhave is 2 so that it can donate 1 while keeping the other 1 for itself.\nEarlier, we only donated from cgroups with sizable surpluses so this\ncondition was always true. However, with the precise donation algorithm\nimplemented, f1de2439ec43 (\"blk-iocost: revamp donation amount\ndetermination\") made the donation amount calculation exact enabling even low\nhweight cgroups to donate.\n\nThis means that in rare occasions, a cgroup with active hweight of 1 can\nenter donation calculation triggering the following warning and then a\ndivide-by-zero oops.\n\n WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 0 at block/blk-iocost.c:1928 transfer_surpluses.cold+0x0/0x53 [884/94867]\n ...\n RIP: 0010:transfer_surpluses.cold+0x0/0x53\n Code: 92 ff 48 c7 c7 28 d1 ab b5 65 48 8b 34 25 00 ae 01 00 48 81 c6 90 06 00 00 e8 8b 3f fe ff 48 c7 c0 ea ff ff ff e9 95 ff 92 ff <0f> 0b 48 c7 c7 30 da ab b5 e8 71 3f fe ff 4c 89 e8 4d 85 ed 74 0\n4\n ...\n Call Trace:\n  <IRQ>\n  ioc_timer_fn+0x1043/0x1390\n  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2c0\n  __run_timers.part.0+0x1ec/0x2e0\n  run_timer_softirq+0x35/0x70\n ...\n iocg: invalid donation weights in /a/b: active=1 donating=1 after=0\n\nFix it by excluding cgroups w/ active hweight < 2 from donating.

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbonding: change ipsec_lock from spin lock to mutex\n\nIn the cited commit, bond->ipsec_lock is added to protect ipsec_list,\nhence xdo_dev_state_add and xdo_dev_state_delete are called inside\nthis lock. As ipsec_lock is a spin lock and such xfrmdev ops may sleep,\n\"scheduling while atomic\" will be triggered when changing bond's\nactive slave.\n\n[  101.055189] BUG: scheduling while atomic: bash/902/0x00000200\n[  101.055726] Modules linked in:\n[  101.058211] CPU: 3 PID: 902 Comm: bash Not tainted 6.9.0-rc4+ #1\n[  101.058760] Hardware name:\n[  101.059434] Call Trace:\n[  101.059436]  <TASK>\n[  101.060873]  dump_stack_lvl+0x51/0x60\n[  101.061275]  __schedule_bug+0x4e/0x60\n[  101.061682]  __schedule+0x612/0x7c0\n[  101.062078]  ? __mod_timer+0x25c/0x370\n[  101.062486]  schedule+0x25/0xd0\n[  101.062845]  schedule_timeout+0x77/0xf0\n[  101.063265]  ? asm_common_interrupt+0x22/0x40\n[  101.063724]  ? __bpf_trace_itimer_state+0x10/0x10\n[  101.064215]  __wait_for_common+0x87/0x190\n[  101.064648]  ? usleep_range_state+0x90/0x90\n[  101.065091]  cmd_exec+0x437/0xb20 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.065569]  mlx5_cmd_do+0x1e/0x40 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.066051]  mlx5_cmd_exec+0x18/0x30 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.066552]  mlx5_crypto_create_dek_key+0xea/0x120 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.067163]  ? bonding_sysfs_store_option+0x4d/0x80 [bonding]\n[  101.067738]  ? kmalloc_trace+0x4d/0x350\n[  101.068156]  mlx5_ipsec_create_sa_ctx+0x33/0x100 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.068747]  mlx5e_xfrm_add_state+0x47b/0xaa0 [mlx5_core]\n[  101.069312]  bond_change_active_slave+0x392/0x900 [bonding]\n[  101.069868]  bond_option_active_slave_set+0x1c2/0x240 [bonding]\n[  101.070454]  __bond_opt_set+0xa6/0x430 [bonding]\n[  101.070935]  __bond_opt_set_notify+0x2f/0x90 [bonding]\n[  101.071453]  bond_opt_tryset_rtnl+0x72/0xb0 [bonding]\n[  101.071965]  bonding_sysfs_store_option+0x4d/0x80 [bonding]\n[  101.072567]  kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x10c/0x1a0\n[  101.073033]  vfs_write+0x2d8/0x400\n[  101.073416]  ? alloc_fd+0x48/0x180\n[  101.073798]  ksys_write+0x5f/0xe0\n[  101.074175]  do_syscall_64+0x52/0x110\n[  101.074576]  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nAs bond_ipsec_add_sa_all and bond_ipsec_del_sa_all are only called\nfrom bond_change_active_slave, which requires holding the RTNL lock.\nAnd bond_ipsec_add_sa and bond_ipsec_del_sa are xfrm state\nxdo_dev_state_add and xdo_dev_state_delete APIs, which are in user\ncontext. So ipsec_lock doesn't have to be spin lock, change it to\nmutex, and thus the above issue can be resolved.\n    ",

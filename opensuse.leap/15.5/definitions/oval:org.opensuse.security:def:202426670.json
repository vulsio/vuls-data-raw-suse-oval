		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n\nCurrently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't\nquite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit\nmemory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.\n\nThe ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to\nhandle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,\nwhich are described in:\n\n* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en\n* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en\n\nIn both cases the workaround is described as:\n\n| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the\n| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected\n| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:\n|\n| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including\n|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.\n|\n| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.\n\nThe important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed \"after all\nexplicit memory accesses\".\n\nUnfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by\nan LDR, as we have:\n\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n| \teret\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n|\n| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n\nThis patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB\nimmediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.\n\nThe ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives\ncannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for\nARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch\nto skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:\n\n| alternative_insn \"b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@\", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0\n| \t[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]\n| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@:\n|\n| \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR]\n| \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp\n|\n| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD\n| \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr\n| \tdsb\tnsh\n| alternative_else_nop_endif\n| \teret\n\nThe new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is\nnot in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the\nerratum:\n\n| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the\n| issue from occurring.\n\n... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround\nis only necessary \"If pagetable isolation is disabled\".\n    ",

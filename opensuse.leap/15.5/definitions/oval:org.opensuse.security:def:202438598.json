[mdX_resync:6976]\nCPU: 7 PID: 3588 Comm: mdX_resync Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.9.0-rc4-next-20240419 #1\nRIP: 0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irq+0x13/0x30\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n md_bitmap_start_sync+0x6b/0xf0\n raid10_sync_request+0x25c/0x1b40 [raid10]\n md_do_sync+0x64b/0x1020\n md_thread+0xa7/0x170\n kthread+0xcf/0x100\n ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nAnd the detailed process is as follows:\n\nmd_do_sync\n j = mddev->resync_min\n while (j < max_sectors)\n  sectors = raid10_sync_request(mddev, j, &skipped)\n   if (!md_bitmap_start_sync(..., &sync_blocks))\n    // md_bitmap_start_sync set sync_blocks to 0\n    return sync_blocks + sectors_skippe;\n  // sectors = 0;\n  j += sectors;\n  // j never change\n\nRoot cause is that commit 301867b1c168 (\"md/raid10: check\nslab-out-of-bounds in md_bitmap_get_counter\") return early from\nmd_bitmap_get_counter(), without setting returned blocks.\n\nFix this problem by always set returned blocks from\nmd_bitmap_get_counter\"(), as it used to be.\n\nNoted that this patch just fix the softlockup problem in kernel, the\ncase that bitmap size doesn't match array size still need to be fixed.\n    ",

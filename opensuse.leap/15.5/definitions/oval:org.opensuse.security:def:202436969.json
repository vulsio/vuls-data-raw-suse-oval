		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix division by zero in setup_dsc_config\n\nWhen slice_height is 0, the division by slice_height in the calculation\nof the number of slices will cause a division by zero driver crash. This\nleaves the kernel in a state that requires a reboot. This patch adds a\ncheck to avoid the division by zero.\n\nThe stack trace below is for the 6.8.4 Kernel. I reproduced the issue on\na Z16 Gen 2 Lenovo Thinkpad with a Apple Studio Display monitor\nconnected via Thunderbolt. The amdgpu driver crashed with this exception\nwhen I rebooted the system with the monitor connected.\n\nkernel: ? die (arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:421 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:434 arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c:447)\nkernel: ? do_trap (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:113 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:154)\nkernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu\nkernel: ? do_error_trap (./arch/x86/include/asm/traps.h:58 arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:175)\nkernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu\nkernel: ? exc_divide_error (arch/x86/kernel/traps.c:194 (discriminator 2))\nkernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu\nkernel: ? asm_exc_divide_error (./arch/x86/include/asm/idtentry.h:548)\nkernel: ? setup_dsc_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1053) amdgpu\nkernel: dc_dsc_compute_config (drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dsc/dc_dsc.c:1109) amdgpu\n\nAfter applying this patch, the driver no longer crashes when the monitor\nis connected and the system is rebooted. I believe this is the same\nissue reported for 3113.\n    ",

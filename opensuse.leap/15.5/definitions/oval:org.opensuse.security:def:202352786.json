		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix racy may inline data check in dio write\n\nsyzbot reports that the following warning from ext4_iomap_begin()\ntriggers as of the commit referenced below:\n\n        if (WARN_ON_ONCE(ext4_has_inline_data(inode)))\n                return -ERANGE;\n\nThis occurs during a dio write, which is never expected to encounter\nan inode with inline data. To enforce this behavior,\next4_dio_write_iter() checks the current inline state of the inode\nand clears the MAY_INLINE_DATA state flag to either fall back to\nbuffered writes, or enforce that any other writers in progress on\nthe inode are not allowed to create inline data.\n\nThe problem is that the check for existing inline data and the state\nflag can span a lock cycle. For example, if the ilock is originally\nlocked shared and subsequently upgraded to exclusive, another writer\nmay have reacquired the lock and created inline data before the dio\nwrite task acquires the lock and proceeds.\n\nThe commit referenced below loosens the lock requirements to allow\nsome forms of unaligned dio writes to occur under shared lock, but\nAFAICT the inline data check was technically already racy for any\ndio write that would have involved a lock cycle. Regardless, lift\nclearing of the state bit to the same lock critical section that\nchecks for preexisting inline data on the inode to close the race.\n    ",

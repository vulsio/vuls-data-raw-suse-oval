		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: isotp: fix potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()\n\nWhen receiving a CAN frame the current code logic does not consider\nconcurrently receiving processes which do not show up in real world\nusage.\n\nZiyang Xuan writes:\n\nThe following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len is\nchanged by isotp_rcv_ff() during isotp_rcv_cf(), so->rx.len equals\n0 before alloc_skb() and equals 4096 after alloc_skb(). That will\ntrigger skb_over_panic() in skb_put().\n\n=======================================================\nCPU: 1 PID: 19 Comm: ksoftirqd/1 Not tainted 5.16.0-rc8-syzkaller #0\nRIP: 0010:skb_panic+0x16c/0x16e net/core/skbuff.c:113\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n skb_over_panic net/core/skbuff.c:118 [inline]\n skb_put.cold+0x24/0x24 net/core/skbuff.c:1990\n isotp_rcv_cf net/can/isotp.c:570 [inline]\n isotp_rcv+0xa38/0x1e30 net/can/isotp.c:668\n deliver net/can/af_can.c:574 [inline]\n can_rcv_filter+0x445/0x8d0 net/can/af_can.c:635\n can_receive+0x31d/0x580 net/can/af_can.c:665\n can_rcv+0x120/0x1c0 net/can/af_can.c:696\n __netif_receive_skb_one_core+0x114/0x180 net/core/dev.c:5465\n __netif_receive_skb+0x24/0x1b0 net/core/dev.c:5579\n\nTherefore we make sure the state changes and data structures stay\nconsistent at CAN frame reception time by adding a spin_lock in\nisotp_rcv(). This fixes the issue reported by syzkaller but does not\naffect real world operation.\n    ",

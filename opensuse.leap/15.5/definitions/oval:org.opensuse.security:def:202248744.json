		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Avoid field-overflowing memcpy()\n\nIn preparation for FORTIFY_SOURCE performing compile-time and run-time\nfield bounds checking for memcpy(), memmove(), and memset(), avoid\nintentionally writing across neighboring fields.\n\nUse flexible arrays instead of zero-element arrays (which look like they\nare always overflowing) and split the cross-field memcpy() into two halves\nthat can be appropriately bounds-checked by the compiler.\n\nWe were doing:\n\n\t#define ETH_HLEN  14\n\t#define VLAN_HLEN  4\n\t...\n\t#define MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE (ETH_HLEN + VLAN_HLEN)\n\t...\n        struct mlx5e_tx_wqe      *wqe  = mlx5_wq_cyc_get_wqe(wq, pi);\n\t...\n        struct mlx5_wqe_eth_seg  *eseg = &wqe->eth;\n        struct mlx5_wqe_data_seg *dseg = wqe->data;\n\t...\n\tmemcpy(eseg->inline_hdr.start, xdptxd->data, MLX5E_XDP_MIN_INLINE);\n\ntarget is wqe->eth.inline_hdr.start (which the compiler sees as being\n2 bytes in size), but copying 18, intending to write across start\n(really vlan_tci, 2 bytes).

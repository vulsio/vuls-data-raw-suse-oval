		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: carl9170: add a proper sanity check for endpoints\n\nSyzkaller reports [1] hitting a warning which is caused by presence\nof a wrong endpoint type at the URB sumbitting stage. While there\nwas a check for a specific 4th endpoint, since it can switch types\nbetween bulk and interrupt, other endpoints are trusted implicitly.\nSimilar warning is triggered in a couple of other syzbot issues [2].\n\nFix the issue by doing a comprehensive check of all endpoints\ntaking into account difference between high- and full-speed\nconfiguration.\n\n[1] Syzkaller report:\n...\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 4721 at drivers/usb/core/urb.c:504 usb_submit_urb+0xed6/0x1880 drivers/usb/core/urb.c:504\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n carl9170_usb_send_rx_irq_urb+0x273/0x340 drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:504\n carl9170_usb_init_device drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:939 [inline]\n carl9170_usb_firmware_finish drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:999 [inline]\n carl9170_usb_firmware_step2+0x175/0x240 drivers/net/wireless/ath/carl9170/usb.c:1028\n request_firmware_work_func+0x130/0x240 drivers/base/firmware_loader/main.c:1107\n process_one_work+0x9bf/0x1710 kernel/workqueue.c:2289\n worker_thread+0x669/0x1090 kernel/workqueue.c:2436\n kthread+0x2e8/0x3a0 kernel/kthread.c:376\n ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:308\n </TASK>\n\n[2] Related syzkaller crashes:\n    ",

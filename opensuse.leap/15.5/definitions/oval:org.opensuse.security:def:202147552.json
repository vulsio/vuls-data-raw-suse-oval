		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-mq: cancel blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue and disk_release()\n\nFor avoiding to slow down queue destroy, we don't call\nblk_mq_quiesce_queue() in blk_cleanup_queue(), instead of delaying to\ncancel dispatch work in blk_release_queue().\n\nHowever, this way has caused kernel oops[1], reported by Changhui. The log\nshows that scsi_device can be freed before running blk_release_queue(),\nwhich is expected too since scsi_device is released after the scsi disk\nis closed and the scsi_device is removed.\n\nFixes the issue by canceling blk-mq dispatch work in both blk_cleanup_queue()\nand disk_release():\n\n1) when disk_release() is run, the disk has been closed, and any sync\ndispatch activities have been done, so canceling dispatch work is enough to\nquiesce filesystem I/O dispatch activity.\n\n2) in blk_cleanup_queue(), we only focus on passthrough request, and\npassthrough request is always explicitly allocated & freed by\nits caller, so once queue is frozen, all sync dispatch activity\nfor passthrough request has been done, then it is enough to just cancel\ndispatch work for avoiding any dispatch activity.\n\n[1] kernel panic log\n[12622.769416] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000300\n[12622.777186] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[12622.782918] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[12622.788649] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[12622.791474] Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n[12622.796138] CPU: 10 PID: 744 Comm: kworker/10:1H Kdump: loaded Not tainted 5.15.0+ #1\n[12622.804877] Hardware name: Dell Inc.

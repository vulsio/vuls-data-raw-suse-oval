		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/iova: Fix alloc iova overflows issue\n\nIn __alloc_and_insert_iova_range, there is an issue that retry_pfn\noverflows. The value of iovad->anchor.pfn_hi is ~0UL, then when\niovad->cached_node is iovad->anchor, curr_iova->pfn_hi + 1 will\noverflow. As a result, if the retry logic is executed, low_pfn is\nupdated to 0, and then new_pfn < low_pfn returns false to make the\nallocation successful.\n\nThis issue occurs in the following two situations:\n1. The first iova size exceeds the domain size. When initializing\niova domain, iovad->cached_node is assigned as iovad->anchor. For\nexample, the iova domain size is 10M, start_pfn is 0x1_F000_0000,\nand the iova size allocated for the first time is 11M. The\nfollowing is the log information, new->pfn_lo is smaller than\niovad->cached_node.\n\nExample log as follows:\n[  223.798112][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nstart_pfn:0x1f0000,retry_pfn:0x0,size:0xb00,limit_pfn:0x1f0a00\n[  223.799590][T1705487] sh: [name:iova&]__alloc_and_insert_iova_range\nsuccess start_pfn:0x1f0000,new->pfn_lo:0x1efe00,new->pfn_hi:0x1f08ff\n\n2. The node with the largest iova->pfn_lo value in the iova domain\nis deleted, iovad->cached_node will be updated to iovad->anchor,\nand then the alloc iova size exceeds the maximum iova size that can\nbe allocated in the domain.\n\nAfter judging that retry_pfn is less than limit_pfn, call retry_pfn+1\nto fix the overflow issue.\n    ",

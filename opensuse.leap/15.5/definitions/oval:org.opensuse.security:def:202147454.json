		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline\n\nWith PREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we\nget:\n\nBUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000\nno locks held by swapper/1/0.\nCPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100\nCall Trace:\n dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108\n __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0\n __schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0\n schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70\n do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0\n cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40\n start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0\n start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14\n\nThis is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's\npreempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 (\"powerpc:\nRe-enable preemption before cpu_die()\"), specifically \"start_secondary()\nexpects a preempt_count() of 0.\"\n\nHowever, since commit 2c669ef6979c (\"powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle\ntask's preempt_count during hotplug\") and commit f1a0a376ca0c (\"sched/core:\nInitialize the idle task with preemption disabled\"), that justification no\nlonger holds.\n\nThe idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the\nvestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.\n\nTested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.\n    ",

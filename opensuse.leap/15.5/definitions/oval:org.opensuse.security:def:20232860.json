		"Description": "\n    An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in the SR-IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel. The flaw exists within the processing of seg6 attributes. The issue results from the improper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows a privileged local user to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux kernel.\n    ",

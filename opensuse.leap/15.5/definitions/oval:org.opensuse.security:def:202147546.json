		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: fix memory leak in fib6_rule_suppress\n\nThe kernel leaks memory when a `fib` rule is present in IPv6 nftables\nfirewall rules and a suppress_prefix rule is present in the IPv6 routing\nrules (used by certain tools such as wg-quick). In such scenarios, every\nincoming packet will leak an allocation in `ip6_dst_cache` slab cache.\n\nAfter some hours of `bpftrace`-ing and source code reading, I tracked\ndown the issue to ca7a03c41753 (\"ipv6: do not free rt if\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule\").\n\nThe problem with that change is that the generic `args->flags` always have\n`FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF` set[1][2] but the IPv6-specific flag\n`RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF` might not be, leading to `fib6_rule_suppress` not\ndecreasing the refcount when needed.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n - Add the following nftables rule to a prerouting chain:\n     meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n   This can be done with:\n     sudo nft create table inet test\n     sudo nft create chain inet test test_chain '{ type filter hook prerouting priority filter + 10; policy accept; }'\n     sudo nft add rule inet test test_chain meta nfproto ipv6 fib saddr . mark . iif oif missing drop\n - Run:\n     sudo ip -6 rule add table main suppress_prefixlength 0\n - Watch `sudo slabtop -o | grep ip6_dst_cache` to see memory usage increase\n   with every incoming ipv6 packet.\n\nThis patch exposes the protocol-specific flags to the protocol\nspecific `suppress` function, and check the protocol-specific `flags`\nargument for RT6_LOOKUP_F_DST_NOREF instead of the generic\nFIB_LOOKUP_NOREF when decreasing the refcount, like this.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L71\n[2]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/ca7a03c4175366a92cee0ccc4fec0038c3266e26/net/ipv6/fib6_rules.c#L99\n    ",

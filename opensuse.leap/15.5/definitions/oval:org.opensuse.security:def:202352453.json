		"Description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhisi_acc_vfio_pci: Update migration data pointer correctly on saving/resume\n\nWhen the optional PRE_COPY support was added to speed up the device\ncompatibility check, it failed to update the saving/resuming data\npointers based on the fd offset. This results in migration data\ncorruption and when the device gets started on the destination the\nfollowing error is reported in some cases,\n\n[  478.907684] arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.2.auto: event 0x10 received:\n[  478.913691] arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.2.auto:  0x0000310200000010\n[  478.919603] arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.2.auto:  0x000002088000007f\n[  478.925515] arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.2.auto:  0x0000000000000000\n[  478.931425] arm-smmu-v3 arm-smmu-v3.2.auto:  0x0000000000000000\n[  478.947552] hisi_zip 0000:31:00.0: qm_axi_rresp [error status=0x1] found\n[  478.955930] hisi_zip 0000:31:00.0: qm_db_timeout [error status=0x400] found\n[  478.955944] hisi_zip 0000:31:00.0: qm sq doorbell timeout in function 2\n    ",

We also seem to clear\nthe lower 16 bits of it with bitmap_zero() for no particular reason (my\nguess would be that 'bitmap' and 'vcpu_bitmap' variables in\nkvm_bitmap_or_dest_vcpus() caused the confusion: while the later is indeed\n16-bit long, the later should accommodate all possible vCPUs).\n    ",

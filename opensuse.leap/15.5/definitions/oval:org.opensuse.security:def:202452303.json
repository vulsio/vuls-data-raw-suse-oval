		"description": "\n    aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.\n    ",

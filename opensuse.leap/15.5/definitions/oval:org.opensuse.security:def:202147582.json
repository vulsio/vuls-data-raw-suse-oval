		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nUSB: core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable\n\nThe USBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invoke\nusb_start_wait_urb(), which contains an uninterruptible wait with a\nuser-specified timeout value.  If timeout value is very large and the\ndevice being accessed does not respond in a reasonable amount of time,\nthe kernel will complain about \"Task X blocked for more than N\nseconds\", as found in testing by syzbot:\n\nINFO: task syz-executor.0:8700 blocked for more than 143 seconds.\n      Not tainted 5.14.0-rc7-syzkaller #0\n\"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs\" disables this message.\ntask:syz-executor.0  state:D stack:23192 pid: 8700 ppid:  8455 flags:0x00004004\nCall Trace:\n context_switch kernel/sched/core.c:4681 [inline]\n __schedule+0xc07/0x11f0 kernel/sched/core.c:5938\n schedule+0x14b/0x210 kernel/sched/core.c:6017\n schedule_timeout+0x98/0x2f0 kernel/time/timer.c:1857\n do_wait_for_common+0x2da/0x480 kernel/sched/completion.c:85\n __wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:106 [inline]\n wait_for_common kernel/sched/completion.c:117 [inline]\n wait_for_completion_timeout+0x46/0x60 kernel/sched/completion.c:157\n usb_start_wait_urb+0x167/0x550 drivers/usb/core/message.c:63\n do_proc_bulk+0x978/0x1080 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1236\n proc_bulk drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1273 [inline]\n usbdev_do_ioctl drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2547 [inline]\n usbdev_ioctl+0x3441/0x6b10 drivers/usb/core/devio.c:2713\n...\n\nTo fix this problem, this patch replaces usbfs's calls to\nusb_control_msg() and usb_bulk_msg() with special-purpose code that\ndoes essentially the same thing (as recommended in the comment for\nusb_start_wait_urb()), except that it always uses a killable wait and\nit uses GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOIO.\n    ",

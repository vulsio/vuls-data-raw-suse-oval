		"Description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix use-after-free in tw_timer_handler\n\nA real world panic issue was found as follow in Linux 5.4.\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffde49a863de28\n    PGD 7e6fe62067 P4D 7e6fe62067 PUD 7e6fe63067 PMD f51e064067 PTE 0\n    RIP: 0010:tw_timer_handler+0x20/0x40\n    Call Trace:\n     <IRQ>\n     call_timer_fn+0x2b/0x120\n     run_timer_softirq+0x1ef/0x450\n     __do_softirq+0x10d/0x2b8\n     irq_exit+0xc7/0xd0\n     smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x68/0x120\n     apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20\n\nThis issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1],\nunfortunately, the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing\nDCCP.\n\nThe ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net\nnamespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore\nipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops\nin the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on\nnet->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net\nif there are some inflight time-wait timers.\n\nThis bug is not introduced by commit f2bf415cfed7 (\"mib: add net to\nNET_ADD_STATS_BH\") since the net_statistics is a global variable\ninstead of dynamic allocation and freeing. Actually, commit\n61a7e26028b9 (\"mib: put net statistics on struct net\") introduces\nthe bug since it put net statistics on struct net and free it when\nnet namespace is destroyed.\n\nMoving init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug\nand replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless\nwhen init_ipv4_mibs() fails.\n\n[1] https://groups.google.com/g/syzkaller/c/p1tn-_Kc6l4/m/smuL_FMAAgAJ?pli=1\n    ",

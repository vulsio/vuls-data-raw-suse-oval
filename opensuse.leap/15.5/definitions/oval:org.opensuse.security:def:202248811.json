		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nibmvnic: don't release napi in __ibmvnic_open()\n\nIf __ibmvnic_open() encounters an error such as when setting link state,\nit calls release_resources() which frees the napi structures needlessly.\nInstead, have __ibmvnic_open() only clean up the work it did so far (i.e.\ndisable napi and irqs) and leave the rest to the callers.\n\nIf caller of __ibmvnic_open() is ibmvnic_open(), it should release the\nresources immediately. If the caller is do_reset() or do_hard_reset(),\nthey will release the resources on the next reset.\n\nThis fixes following crash that occurred when running the drmgr command\nseveral times to add/remove a vnic interface:\n\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[6] irq\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Disabling rx_scrq[7] irq\n\t[102056] ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Replenished 8 pools\n\tKernel attempted to read user page (10) - exploit attempt?

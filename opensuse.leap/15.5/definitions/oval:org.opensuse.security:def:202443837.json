But this will lead to `libbpf_probe_bpf_prog_type`\nAPI broken which use verifier log to probe prog type and will log\nnothing if we reject invalid EXT prog before bpf_check().\n\nAnother way is by adding null check in resolve_prog_type().\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 4a9c7bbe2ed4 (\"bpf: Resolve to\nprog->aux->dst_prog->type only for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT\") which wanted\nto correct type resolution for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING programs. Before\nthat, the type resolution of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT prog actually follows\nthe logic below:\n\n  prog->aux->dst_prog ? prog->aux->dst_prog->type : prog->type;\n\nIt implies that when EXT program is not yet attached to `dst_prog`,\nthe prog type should be EXT itself. This code worked fine in the past.\nSo just keep using it.\n\nFix this by returning `prog->type` for BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT if `dst_prog`\nis not present in resolve_prog_type().\n    ",

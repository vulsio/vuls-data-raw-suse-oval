		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issue\n\nWe encountered a crash in smc_setsockopt() and it is caused by\naccessing smc->clcsock after clcsock was released.\n\n BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n PGD 0 P4D 0\n Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n CPU: 1 PID: 50309 Comm: nginx Kdump: loaded Tainted: G E     5.16.0-rc4+ #53\n RIP: 0010:smc_setsockopt+0x59/0x280 [smc]\n Call Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  __sys_setsockopt+0xfc/0x190\n  __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x20/0x30\n  do_syscall_64+0x34/0x90\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n RIP: 0033:0x7f16ba83918e\n  </TASK>\n\nThis patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock and\nchecking whether clcsock has already been released before access.\n\nIn case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt()\nor smc_switch_to_fallback(), this patch also checkes smc->clcsock\nin them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identify\nwhether fallback succeeds according to the return value.\n    ",

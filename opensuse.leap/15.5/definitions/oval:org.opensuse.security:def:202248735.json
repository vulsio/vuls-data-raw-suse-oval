		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: Fix UAF of leds class devs at unbinding\n\nThe LED class devices that are created by HD-audio codec drivers are\nregistered via devm_led_classdev_register() and associated with the\nHD-audio codec device.  Unfortunately, it turned out that the devres\nrelease doesn't work for this case; namely, since the codec resource\nrelease happens before the devm call chain, it triggers a NULL\ndereference or a UAF for a stale set_brightness_delay callback.\n\nFor fixing the bug, this patch changes the LED class device register\nand unregister in a manual manner without devres, keeping the\ninstances in hda_gen_spec.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: avoid online resizing failures due to oversized flex bg\n\nWhen we online resize an ext4 filesystem with a oversized flexbg_size,\n\n     mkfs.ext4 -F -G 67108864 $dev -b 4096 100M\n     mount $dev $dir\n     resize2fs $dev 16G\n\nthe following WARN_ON is triggered:\n==================================================================\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 427 at mm/page_alloc.c:4402 __alloc_pages+0x411/0x550\nModules linked in: sg(E)\nCPU: 0 PID: 427 Comm: resize2fs Tainted: G  E  6.6.0-rc5+ #314\nRIP: 0010:__alloc_pages+0x411/0x550\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n __kmalloc_large_node+0xa2/0x200\n __kmalloc+0x16e/0x290\n ext4_resize_fs+0x481/0xd80\n __ext4_ioctl+0x1616/0x1d90\n ext4_ioctl+0x12/0x20\n __x64_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x150\n do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90\n==================================================================\n\nThis is because flexbg_size is too large and the size of the new_group_data\narray to be allocated exceeds MAX_ORDER. Currently, the minimum value of\nMAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the corresponding\nmaximum number of groups that can be allocated is:\n\n (PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) ~ 21845\n\nAnd the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,\nthis value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups added\neach time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multiple\ntimes to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadata\nin a flex_bg may be more dispersed.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/exynos: hdmi: report safe 640x480 mode as a fallback when no EDID found\n\nWhen reading EDID fails and driver reports no modes available, the DRM\ncore adds an artificial 1024x786 mode to the connector. Unfortunately\nsome variants of the Exynos HDMI (like the one in Exynos4 SoCs) are not\nable to drive such mode, so report a safe 640x480 mode instead of nothing\nin case of the EDID reading failure.\n\nThis fixes the following issue observed on Trats2 board since commit\n13d5b040363c (\"drm/exynos: do not return negative values from .get_modes()\"):\n\n[drm] Exynos DRM: using 11c00000.fimd device for DMA mapping operations\nexynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 11c00000.fimd (ops fimd_component_ops)\nexynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 12c10000.mixer (ops mixer_component_ops)\nexynos-dsi 11c80000.dsi: [drm:samsung_dsim_host_attach] Attached s6e8aa0 device (lanes:4 bpp:24 mode-flags:0x10b)\nexynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 11c80000.dsi (ops exynos_dsi_component_ops)\nexynos-drm exynos-drm: bound 12d00000.hdmi (ops hdmi_component_ops)\n[drm] Initialized exynos 1.1.0 20180330 for exynos-drm on minor 1\nexynos-hdmi 12d00000.hdmi: [drm:hdmiphy_enable.part.0] *ERROR* PLL could not reach steady state\npanel-samsung-s6e8aa0 11c80000.dsi.0: ID: 0xa2, 0x20, 0x8c\nexynos-mixer 12c10000.mixer: timeout waiting for VSYNC\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 11 at drivers/gpu/drm/drm_atomic_helper.c:1682 drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x2b0/0x2b8\n[CRTC:70:crtc-1] vblank wait timed out\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 1 PID: 11 Comm: kworker/u16:0 Not tainted 6.9.0-rc5-next-20240424 #14913\nHardware name: Samsung Exynos (Flattened Device Tree)\nWorkqueue: events_unbound deferred_probe_work_func\nCall trace:\n unwind_backtrace from show_stack+0x10/0x14\n show_stack from dump_stack_lvl+0x68/0x88\n dump_stack_lvl from __warn+0x7c/0x1c4\n __warn from warn_slowpath_fmt+0x11c/0x1a8\n warn_slowpath_fmt from drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0+0x2b0/0x2b8\n drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks.part.0 from drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm+0x7c/0x8c\n drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail_rpm from commit_tail+0x9c/0x184\n commit_tail from drm_atomic_helper_commit+0x168/0x190\n drm_atomic_helper_commit from drm_atomic_commit+0xb4/0xe0\n drm_atomic_commit from drm_client_modeset_commit_atomic+0x23c/0x27c\n drm_client_modeset_commit_atomic from drm_client_modeset_commit_locked+0x60/0x1cc\n drm_client_modeset_commit_locked from drm_client_modeset_commit+0x24/0x40\n drm_client_modeset_commit from __drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked+0x9c/0xc4\n __drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked from drm_fb_helper_set_par+0x2c/0x3c\n drm_fb_helper_set_par from fbcon_init+0x3d8/0x550\n fbcon_init from visual_init+0xc0/0x108\n visual_init from do_bind_con_driver+0x1b8/0x3a4\n do_bind_con_driver from do_take_over_console+0x140/0x1ec\n do_take_over_console from do_fbcon_takeover+0x70/0xd0\n do_fbcon_takeover from fbcon_fb_registered+0x19c/0x1ac\n fbcon_fb_registered from register_framebuffer+0x190/0x21c\n register_framebuffer from __drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock+0x350/0x574\n __drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock from exynos_drm_fbdev_client_hotplug+0x6c/0xb0\n exynos_drm_fbdev_client_hotplug from drm_client_register+0x58/0x94\n drm_client_register from exynos_drm_bind+0x160/0x190\n exynos_drm_bind from try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device+0x200/0x2d8\n try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device from __component_add+0xb0/0x170\n __component_add from mixer_probe+0x74/0xcc\n mixer_probe from platform_probe+0x5c/0xb8\n platform_probe from really_probe+0xe0/0x3d8\n really_probe from __driver_probe_device+0x9c/0x1e4\n __driver_probe_device from driver_probe_device+0x30/0xc0\n driver_probe_device from __device_attach_driver+0xa8/0x120\n __device_attach_driver from bus_for_each_drv+0x80/0xcc\n bus_for_each_drv from __device_attach+0xac/0x1fc\n __device_attach from bus_probe_device+0x8c/0x90\n bus_probe_device from deferred_probe_work_func+0\n---truncated---\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp/dccp: Don't use timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink().\n\nMartin KaFai Lau reported use-after-free [0] in reqsk_timer_handler().\n\n  \"\"\"\n  We are seeing a use-after-free from a bpf prog attached to\n  trace_tcp_retransmit_synack. The program passes the req->sk to the\n  bpf_sk_storage_get_tracing kernel helper which does check for null\n  before using it.\n  \"\"\"\n\nThe commit 83fccfc3940c (\"inet: fix potential deadlock in\nreqsk_queue_unlink()\") added timer_pending() in reqsk_queue_unlink() not\nto call del_timer_sync() from reqsk_timer_handler(), but it introduced a\nsmall race window.\n\nBefore the timer is called, expire_timers() calls detach_timer(timer, true)\nto clear timer->entry.pprev and marks it as not pending.\n\nIf reqsk_queue_unlink() checks timer_pending() just after expire_timers()\ncalls detach_timer(), TCP will miss del_timer_sync(); the reqsk timer will\ncontinue running and send multiple SYN+ACKs until it expires.\n\nThe reported UAF could happen if req->sk is close()d earlier than the timer\nexpiration, which is 63s by default.\n\nThe scenario would be\n\n  1. inet_csk_complete_hashdance() calls inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop(),\n     but del_timer_sync() is missed\n\n  2. reqsk timer is executed and scheduled again\n\n  3. req->sk is accept()ed and reqsk_put() decrements rsk_refcnt, but\n     reqsk timer still has another one, and inet_csk_accept() does not\n     clear req->sk for non-TFO sockets\n\n  4. sk is close()d\n\n  5. reqsk timer is executed again, and BPF touches req->sk\n\nLet's not use timer_pending() by passing the caller context to\n__inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop().\n\nNote that reqsk timer is pinned, so the issue does not happen in most\nuse cases.

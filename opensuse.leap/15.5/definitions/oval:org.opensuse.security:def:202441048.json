Due to the different implementations depending on the\narchitecture, page_address(NULL) will trigger a panic on Loongarch\nplatform but not on x86 platform. So this bug was hidden on x86 platform\nfor a while, but now it is exposed on Loongarch platform. The root cause\nis that a zero length skb (skb->len == 0) was put on the queue.\n\nThis zero length skb is a TCP FIN packet, which was sent by shutdown(),\ninvoked in test_sockmap_skb_verdict_shutdown():\n\n\tshutdown(p1, SHUT_WR);\n\nIn this case, in sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(), num_sge is zero, and no\npage is put to this sge (see sg_set_page in sg_set_page), but this empty\nsge is queued into ingress_msg list.\n\nAnd in sk_msg_recvmsg(), this empty sge is used, and a NULL page is got by\nsg_page(sge). Pass this NULL page to copy_page_to_iter(), which passes it\nto kmap_local_page() and to page_address(), then kernel panics.\n\nTo solve this, we should skip this zero length skb. So in sk_msg_recvmsg(),\nif copy is zero, that means it's a zero length skb, skip invoking\ncopy_page_to_iter(). We are using the EFAULT return triggered by\ncopy_page_to_iter to check for is_fin in tcp_bpf.c.\n    ",

		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC\n\nThe below warning is splatting during guest reboot.\n\n  ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322 kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]\n  CPU: 0 PID: 1931 Comm: qemu-system-x86 Tainted: G          I       5.17.0-rc1+ #5\n  RIP: 0010:kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x279/0x710 [kvm]\n   __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0\n   do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae\n  RIP: 0033:0x7fd39797350b\n\nThis can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot in\nthe guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path\nwill not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears\nAPIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode\nswitch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption\ntimer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when\nnot exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption\ntimer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timer\nunder KVM_SET_LAPIC.\n    ",

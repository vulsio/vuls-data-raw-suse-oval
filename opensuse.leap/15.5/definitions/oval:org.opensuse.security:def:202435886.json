		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix infinite recursion in fib6_dump_done().\n\nsyzkaller reported infinite recursive calls of fib6_dump_done() during\nnetlink socket destruction.  [1]\n\nFrom the log, syzkaller sent an AF_UNSPEC RTM_GETROUTE message, and then\nthe response was generated.  The following recvmmsg() resumed the dump\nfor IPv6, but the first call of inet6_dump_fib() failed at kzalloc() due\nto the fault injection.  [0]\n\n  12:01:34 executing program 3:\n  r0 = socket$nl_route(0x10, 0x3, 0x0)\n  sendmsg$nl_route(r0, ... snip ...)\n  recvmmsg(r0, ... snip ...) (fail_nth: 8)\n\nHere, fib6_dump_done() was set to nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done, and the next call\nof inet6_dump_fib() set it to nlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3].  syzkaller stopped\nreceiving the response halfway through, and finally netlink_sock_destruct()\ncalled nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done().\n\nfib6_dump_done() calls fib6_dump_end() and nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() if it\nis still not NULL.  fib6_dump_end() rewrites nlk_sk(sk)->cb.done() by\nnlk_sk(sk)->cb.args[3], but it has the same function, not NULL, calling\nitself recursively and hitting the stack guard page.\n\nTo avoid the issue, let's set the destructor after kzalloc().\n\n[0]:\nFAULT_INJECTION: forcing a failure.\nname failslab, interval 1, probability 0, space 0, times 0\nCPU: 1 PID: 432110 Comm: syz-executor.3 Not tainted 6.8.0-12821-g537c2e91d354-dirty #11\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack_lvl (lib/dump_stack.c:117)\n should_fail_ex (lib/fault-inject.c:52 lib/fault-inject.c:153)\n should_failslab (mm/slub.c:3733)\n kmalloc_trace (mm/slub.c:3748 mm/slub.c:3827 mm/slub.c:3992)\n inet6_dump_fib (./include/linux/slab.h:628 ./include/linux/slab.h:749 net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:662)\n rtnl_dump_all (net/core/rtnetlink.c:4029)\n netlink_dump (net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2269)\n netlink_recvmsg (net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1988)\n ____sys_recvmsg (net/socket.c:1046 net/socket.c:2801)\n ___sys_recvmsg (net/socket.c:2846)\n do_recvmmsg (net/socket.c:2943)\n __x64_sys_recvmmsg (net/socket.c:3041 net/socket.c:3034 net/socket.c:3034)\n\n[1]:\nBUG: TASK stack guard page was hit at 00000000f2fa9af1 (stack is 00000000b7912430..000000009a436beb)\nstack guard page: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN\nCPU: 1 PID: 223719 Comm: kworker/1:3 Not tainted 6.8.0-12821-g537c2e91d354-dirty #11\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nWorkqueue: events netlink_sock_destruct_work\nRIP: 0010:fib6_dump_done (net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:570)\nCode: 3c 24 e8 f3 e9 51 fd e9 28 fd ff ff 66 66 2e 0f 1f 84 00 00 00 00 00 0f 1f 00 f3 0f 1e fa 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 55 48 89 fd <53> 48 8d 5d 60 e8 b6 4d 07 fd 48 89 da 48 b8 00 00 00 00 00 fc ff\nRSP: 0018:ffffc9000d980000 EFLAGS: 00010293\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffffff84405990 RCX: ffffffff844059d3\nRDX: ffff8881028e0000 RSI: ffffffff84405ac2 RDI: ffff88810c02f358\nRBP: ffff88810c02f358 R08: 0000000000000007 R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: 0000000000000000 R11: 0000000000000224 R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: ffff888007c82c78 R14: ffff888007c82c68 R15: ffff888007c82c68\nFS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88811b100000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: ffffc9000d97fff8 CR3: 0000000102309002 CR4: 0000000000770ef0\nPKRU: 55555554\nCall Trace:\n <#DF>\n </#DF>\n <TASK>\n fib6_dump_done (net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:572 (discriminator 1))\n fib6_dump_done (net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:572 (discriminator 1))\n ...\n fib6_dump_done (net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:572 (discriminator 1))\n fib6_dump_done (net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c:572 (discriminator 1))\n netlink_sock_destruct (net/netlink/af_netlink.c:401)\n __sk_destruct (net/core/sock.c:2177 (discriminator 2))\n sk_destruct (net/core/sock.c:2224)\n __sk_free (net/core/sock.c:2235)\n sk_free (net/core/sock.c:2246)\n process_one_work (kernel/workqueue.c:3259)\n worker_thread (kernel/workqueue.c:3329 kernel/workqueue.\n---truncated---\n    ",

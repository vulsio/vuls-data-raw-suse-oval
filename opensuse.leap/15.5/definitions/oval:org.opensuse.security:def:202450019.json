		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkthread: unpark only parked kthread\n\nCalling into kthread unparking unconditionally is mostly harmless when\nthe kthread is already unparked. The wake up is then simply ignored\nbecause the target is not in TASK_PARKED state.\n\nHowever if the kthread is per CPU, the wake up is preceded by a call\nto kthread_bind() which expects the task to be inactive and in\nTASK_PARKED state, which obviously isn't the case if it is unparked.\n\nAs a result, calling kthread_stop() on an unparked per-cpu kthread\ntriggers such a warning:\n\n\tWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at kernel/kthread.c:525 __kthread_bind_mask kernel/kthread.c:525\n\t <TASK>\n\t kthread_stop+0x17a/0x630 kernel/kthread.c:707\n\t destroy_workqueue+0x136/0xc40 kernel/workqueue.c:5810\n\t wg_destruct+0x1e2/0x2e0 drivers/net/wireguard/device.c:257\n\t netdev_run_todo+0xe1a/0x1000 net/core/dev.c:10693\n\t default_device_exit_batch+0xa14/0xa90 net/core/dev.c:11769\n\t ops_exit_list net/core/net_namespace.c:178 [inline]\n\t cleanup_net+0x89d/0xcc0 net/core/net_namespace.c:640\n\t process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3231 [inline]\n\t process_scheduled_works+0xa2c/0x1830 kernel/workqueue.c:3312\n\t worker_thread+0x86d/0xd70 kernel/workqueue.c:3393\n\t kthread+0x2f0/0x390 kernel/kthread.c:389\n\t ret_from_fork+0x4b/0x80 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147\n\t ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244\n\t </TASK>\n\nFix this with skipping unecessary unparking while stopping a kthread.\n    ",

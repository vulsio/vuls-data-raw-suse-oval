		"description": "\n    In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation\n\nIn rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O\nthread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gap\nbetween the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()\nfrom the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O\nthread.\n\nAs a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's\nno I/O thread yet.\n\nA better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such\nthat the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.\n    ",
